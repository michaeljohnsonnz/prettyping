# Pretty Ping

Experimenting with some awesome shell programs as part of our class. We had to choose 3 programs to present to our class. I've chosen `prettyping` as one of mine.

## Requirements

- `bash`
- `awk` (`gawk`, `mawk`, `nawk`, `busybox awk`)
- `ping`
- `stty`
- `tput`

## Install

I know it's a little overkill but I wanted to practice my bash scripting and automated the task of installing `prettyping`

```bash
bash install_prettyping.sh
```

Then run the prettyping program in bash

```bash
bash prettyping google.com
```
